# MystoreProject
MyStore is a capstone project for Udacity's Fullstack Web Developer with Javascript course.

Briefly, it is about an online store (e-commerce) pretty much like Amazon.com. In this case the features are the basic ones of an online store. User can browse products, view their details, add/remove/update them to/from their shopping cart.

I have used Angular v13.1.4

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Prettier/Linter

Run `npm run perfect`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
